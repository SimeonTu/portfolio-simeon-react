/* React-draggable moves elements with CSS transforms. The legacy `.browser-frame` centers the window
   using `top/left` + `transform: translate(...)`, which clashes with react-draggable and causes the
   element to snap to (0,0) when bounds are enforced. In React, we compute the initial centered x/y
   in JS and let react-draggable fully own transforms. */

/* Intentionally minimal: avoid fighting legacy `.browser-frame` positioning.
   We use react-draggable `positionOffset` to preserve the legacy centering while dragging. */
